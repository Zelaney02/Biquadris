# Biquadris

<strong>Project: Biquadris Game</strong>

<p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
Developed Biquadris, a Tetris-inspired game, as part of a collaborative software development project. The game features comprehensive block manipulation, custom levels, special actions, and a user-friendly interface. Ensured the game was fully functional, well-documented, and adhered to software engineering principles.</p>

<p><strong>Key Responsibilities and Contributions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Core Game Logic:</strong> Designed and implemented the core game mechanics, including block movement, rotation, placement, row clearing, and game over conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Developed a text-based user interface and command interpreter to facilitate seamless interaction between the player and the game.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced Features:</strong> Integrated advanced features such as block rotations, special actions triggered by game events, and additional difficulty levels.</li>
  <li><strong>UML Modeling:</strong> Created and maintained UML class diagrams to accurately represent the structure and relationships of the game components.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Authored comprehensive project reports detailing design choices, implementation strategies, and challenges encountered.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing and Validation:</strong> Built a thorough test suite to ensure the correctness and reliability of the game, conducting extensive testing and debugging.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technologies and Tools:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> C++</li>
  <li><strong>Build System:</strong> CMake</li>
  <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git</li>
  <li><strong>UML Tools:</strong> Lucidchart</li>
  <li><strong>IDE:</strong> VSCode</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design Patterns Utilized:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Factory Method:</strong> For managing different difficulty levels and customizing block generation.</li>
  <li><strong>Decorator:</strong> For handling multiple simultaneous effects within the game.</li>
  <li><strong>Command:</strong> For flexible command handling and interpreter design.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Successfully developed a fully functional and engaging game within a tight deadline.</li>
  <li>Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills and the ability to adapt design patterns to solve complex software engineering problems.</li>
  <li>Collaborated effectively with team members, ensuring smooth integration of various components and features.</li>
  <li>Delivered a polished final product with detailed documentation and robust testing, meeting all project requirements and deadlines.</li>
</ul>
